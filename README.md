# ON SUNNY DAYS 

## The idea
Create a website which display the weather depending on the user input on the search bar.
Depeding on the weather, advices are proposed to the user so he can get the best of his day:
 - "Don't forget to bring an umbrella along" in case it is raining
 - "Suncreen is a must have these days" suring sunny days

## What did I learned building this project ?

This was my first time building a whole project from stratch.
Even though my idea was pretty simple there were a lot of extra task that I don't usually do which took me a lot of time like:
- creating a small logo on Figma
- learning what JSON is
- learning how to use and API (this was my first time trying, it is less difficult than I thought)
- learning how to debug (I have spend so much time debugging, it was not that fun but at least i managed to figure a lot of mistake)

Always call API with HTTPS adress in github
